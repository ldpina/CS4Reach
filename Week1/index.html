  <p>Hi, my name is Luis Pina. I am currently a 3rd year @UCSD majoring
    in Cognitve Science with Specialziation in Design and Interaction. After
    college I would like to become either a software engineer or a cloud engineer.
    Things I like to do on my free time are go on runs, recover from being a LoL addict,
    try to become a better cook, and travel. Here is a picture of me at Bryce Canyon National
    Park in Utah :D
